# ElGamal Encryption
## Overview
This is an implementation of the ElGamal encryption algorithm using Windows Forms (C#). The program enables text encryption and decryption using public and private keys based on the discrete logarithm problem.

## Features
- Generate public key (p, a, y) and private key (x).
- Encrypt plaintext into ciphertext.
-Decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext.
- Automatically generate a random value for k.
- Reset all fields to start over.
